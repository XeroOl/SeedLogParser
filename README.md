# SeedLogParser
This code reads through Amidst2^48 and Portal2Stronghold's log files.
Amidst2^48 and Portal2Stronghold, two programs for finding speedrunning seeds for Minecraft any% set seed glitchless, both have output files that aren't user friendly. this code scans over the files to provide nice output in its own log.txt. SeedLogParser overwrites its log.txt each time, so be sure to save your results before parsing the next log.
